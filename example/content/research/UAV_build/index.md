## Project Overview üéØ

An autonomous UAV system built on the MFD Crosswind Mini platform, designed to achieve Level 5 autonomy for agricultural and mapping applications. This project demonstrates advanced autonomous flight capabilities through integration of computer vision, GPS navigation, and real-time telemetry.

## Key Features üåü

- Level 5 autonomous flight capabilities
- Real-time telemetry and mission control
- Advanced GPS navigation with RTK precision
- Computer vision-based obstacle avoidance
- Automated return-to-home functionality
- Dual-camera system for FPV and high-resolution imaging
- Custom ArduPilot-based flight algorithms

## Technical Specifications üìä

## Software Architecture üíª

### Flight Control
The system utilizes a custom ArduPilot-based flight algorithm running on the Pixhawk Cube Orange. The flight control stack includes:

- ArduPilot firmware for core flight operations
- Custom mission planning algorithms
- Real-time telemetry processing
- Fail-safe protocols and return-to-home functionality

### Navigation System
- GPS-guided waypoint navigation
- RTK-enhanced position accuracy
- Dynamic obstacle avoidance
- Automated landing protocols

## Setup Guide üîß

1. **Airframe Assembly**
   - Follow MFD Crosswind Mini assembly guidelines
   - Pay special attention to wing spar alignment
   - Verify all control surfaces move freely

2. **Electronics Installation**
   - Mount Pixhawk Cube Orange centrally
   - Install GPS with clear sky view
   - Position cameras with unobstructed view
   - Route all cables with proper strain relief

3. **Software Configuration**
   - Flash Pixhawk with ArduPilot firmware
   - Configure flight parameters
   - Calibrate sensors and ESCs
   - Test all control systems on ground

## Flight Operations üöÅ

### Pre-flight Checklist
- Battery voltage verification
- Control surface movement check
- GPS lock confirmation
- Telemetry link test
- Fail-safe testing
- Wind condition assessment

### Safety Protocols
- Always maintain visual line of sight
- Keep safety pilot on standby
- Monitor battery voltage
- Observe local flight regulations
- Maintain minimum safe altitude
