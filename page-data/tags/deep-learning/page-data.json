However, the problem of how to optimally allocate low-rank parameters across model layers remains challenging. This paper presents an extended theoretical framework that unifies classical matrix approximation perspectives with data- and curvature-aware approaches, developing both offline and online rank-allocation algorithms with near-optimality guarantees. Our results significantly advance the theoretical understanding of efficient model adaptation while providing strong empirical evidence for adopting curvature- and data-aware rank selection strategies in large-scale applications.","type":"research"}}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"cover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c0af3835955219f9d35b390e3df17a2a/3ea76/ddpm_preview.png","srcSet":"/static/c0af3835955219f9d35b390e3df17a2a/3ea76/ddpm_preview.png 320w,\n/static/c0af3835955219f9d35b390e3df17a2a/2c755/ddpm_preview.png 750w,\n/static/c0af3835955219f9d35b390e3df17a2a/1ec6c/ddpm_preview.png 1080w,\n/static/c0af3835955219f9d35b390e3df17a2a/966f7/ddpm_preview.png 1298w","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/c0af3835955219f9d35b390e3df17a2a/4a8d5/ddpm_preview.webp 320w,\n/static/c0af3835955219f9d35b390e3df17a2a/a36ff/ddpm_preview.webp 750w,\n/static/c0af3835955219f9d35b390e3df17a2a/afc13/ddpm_preview.webp 1080w,\n/static/c0af3835955219f9d35b390e3df17a2a/efa01/ddpm_preview.webp 1298w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 320px) 320px, 100vw"}]},"width":320,"height":180}}}},"fields":{"slug":{"links":[{"name":"pdf","url":"/files/db7e6d8a2134ed8de8bf466b3d37e9b3/442_final_report-combined.pdf"}],"date":"1714435200000","venue":"University Research Project","authors":["Liam Cawley","Alexandra Lavacek","Sophia Tesic"],"path":"research/super-resolution-ddpm","title":"DDPM for Super Resolution","tags":["deep-learning","computer-vision","super-resolution","ddpm","neural-networks","research"],"excerpt":"This research explores novel approaches for single image super resolution using deep learning techniques inspired by Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM).
