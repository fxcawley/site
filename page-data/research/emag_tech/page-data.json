The angle that maximizes the spectral power is used to estimate the angle of arrival. \n- [Capon beamformer](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA433961.pdf)\n  - Also known as the minimum-variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming algorithm, the Capon beamformer offers better resolution than the Bartlett approach. However, it has higher complexity due to the need for full-rank matrix inversion. Recent advances in GPU computing have made real-time Capon beamforming more feasible. \n- [MUSIC beamformer](https://sci-hub.se/10.1109/IBCAST.2014.6778172)\n  - The MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) beamforming algorithm starts by decomposing the covariance matrix for both the signal and noise parts. It uses the noise sub-space of the spatial covariance matrix in the denominator of the Capon algorithm, thus known as subspace beamformer. This approach provides better Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation compared to the Capon beamformer. The ESPRIT algorithm can be used as an alternative approach.\n- [Artificial Intelligence](https://sci-hub.se/10.1109/MAP.2020.3036097)\n  - The ongoing trend in digital signal processing for DAA involves the use of Artificial Intelligence technologies.\n\n## Problem Statement 📓\n\nGiven the complex and multidimensional nature of our problem, we don't have a well-defined function relating the beamformer wave magnitude to the phase shifter and attenuator values. As a result, we use metaheuristic algorithms to search the solution space for an optimal solution efficiently. \n\nTo evaluate the performance of these metaheuristic algorithms, we demonstrate their effectiveness on the classic NP-hard NQueens problem because of its multidimensional and computationally heavy nature. We use several different metaheuristics (Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing, Steepest Ascent Random Restart, and Quantum Annealing) and rate them based on their calls to the fitness function and convergence to the optimal solution.\n\n## Solution Approach 👩‍🔬\n\nThe main bottleneck in our problem is the calls to the fitness function because each call requires us to loop through the entire system: from the beamformer to grab the state, through the Software Defined Radio (SDR) to digitize the signal, and then back to the Python program to rate its efficacy. \n\nThe bin folder contains our work on a closer representation of the real problem. Here, we take a 16x16 string of 6-bit integers and optimize it to the optimal state, which is a randomly generated 16x16 string of 6-bit integers.\n\n## Project Structure 📁\n\n- `n_queens/` - Contains the implementation and tests for metaheuristic algorithms on the NQueens problem.\n- `bin/` - Contains tests of the best-performing algorithms from `n_queens/` on a more representative problem.\n\n## Usage 😳\n\n- To run the NQueens problem, navigate to the `n_queens/` directory and run the Python script corresponding to the algorithm you want to test.\n- To test the algorithms on the representative problem, navigate to the `bin/` directory and run the Python script corresponding to the algorithm you want to test.\n\n## Dependencies 🤘\n\n- Python 3.x\n- NumPy\n- matplotlib\n\n## Contribution ⛑️\n\nContributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome.
